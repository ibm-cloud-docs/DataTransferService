# FAQs

## What is Data Transfer?

This service allows authorized users (generally the account's administrator) to send compatible devices to one of the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} data centers to be connected directly to the account's network. The device is housed in a dedicated rack and is mounted as an iSCSI target for two weeks. During that period, the administrator can access the device on the network to use it with other devices and services on the account. After the two-week period, an extension can be requested to keep the device connected to the network. Otherwise, the device is either returned to the party specified in the request; or the device is destroyed onsite.

## Can a device for data transfer be sent internationally?

Hardware and disks can be sent both domestically and internationally to any of the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer}} data centers. However, you as the Client are responsible for:

- Ensuring that no import or export license is required to ship the Device to the {{site.data.keyword.IBM}} data center, or to return it to Client (if applicable);
- Ensuring that Client or any Client user whose data is included in the Content is not subject to any US Government order that revokes or denies their US export privileges. You must notify {{site.data.keyword.IBM}} immediately if your enterprise or any such user becomes subject to any such order;
- Obtaining all licensing, shipping, and customs clearance for the Device, including paying any duties, taxes, and shipping costs to and from (if applicable) the {{site.data.keyword.IBM}} data center;
- Complying with all applicable laws, including privacy, import and export, which are associated with delivery and return of the Device, and the transfer of Content to the {{site.data.keyword.IBM}} data center; and
- Having proper agreements in place, and obtaining all required permissions, with Clientâ€™s user for any user data Client transfers to the hardware.

Include a pre-paid return shipping label and all appropriate export documents with your shipment. {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer}} packages the device for return by using the label and documents you provided. If return isn't requested, the device is destroyed.


## What types of devices can be sent with a data transfer request?
Use the following guidelines when you select a device or disk (CD or DVD) to submit for data transfer:

- **Hardware Requirements**

   - Power supply must be 208v/220v compatible.

   - Power plug must fit a standard 120v socket (NEMA 5-15P).

   - Device must be USB 2.0 or USB 3.0 compatible.

   - Provide a USB A Male connector (standard USB plug that fits most computers).

- **CD/DVD Requirements**

   - Disks must be submitted in CD books, jewel cases, or similar container. If you want to submit multiple disks, store disks together in a single case or CD book.

   - Each disk must be clearly and uniquely labeled.

## Can the device be sent back sooner or can it stay longer than two weeks?

Yes, your hardware or disks can be returned at any time or can stay connected longer, if necessary. To request a return on an extension, add a comment to the original data transfer request ticket with the appropriate request. If you request a return, {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer}} disconnects and returns the hardware or disks to the return address provided in the original request by using the pre-paid shipping labels and packaging you provided.

If you request an extension, the extension request will be processed as quickly as possible. It's important to note that each extension request extends the time that the device is connected for one week and can be subject to an extension fee. More details will be included when a member of the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} team responds to the request in the original ticket.

Each status on the data transfer ticket indicates the phase of the transfer process for the hardware or disks that were submitted to the data center. Refer to the table for specific details on each status:
