# Data Transfer Service FAQ

## What types of devices can I send with a data transfer request?
Use the following guidelines when selecting a device or disk (CD or DVD) to submit for data transfer:

- Hardware Requirements:
   - Power supply must be 208v/220v compatible.

   - Power plug must fit a standard 120v socket (NEMA 5-15P).

   - Device must be USB 2.0 or USB 3.0 compatible.

   - Provide a USB A Male connector (standard USB plug that fits most computers).
 
- CD/DVD Requirements:

   - Disks must be submitted in CD books, jewel cases, or similar container. If submitting multiple disks, store disks together in a single case or CD book.

   - Each disk must be clearly and uniquely labeled (i.e. Disk A, Disk B, Disk C, etc.).
