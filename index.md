# Getting Started with Data Transfer Service

{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} Data Transfer Service allows customers to send a USB 2.0 or USB 3.0 compatible device and/or CDs and DVDs to a {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} data center to be connected directly to their network to remotely control the data transfer. The device is housed in a dedicated rack located in the customers data center and will be mounted as an iSCSI target.  Our Data Transfer Service is ideal when you need to transfer large amounts of data without using our Private Network and is a service offered free-of-charge to all {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} customers.
